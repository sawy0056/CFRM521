That said, the bank tends to start conservatively before updating its profit targets throughout the year. A year ago it said 2019 would be broadly in line with 2018, then subsequently raised its forecast twice. Nevertheless, the outlook implies about a 7 percent cut to consensus forecasts, UBS Group AG analysts said in a note to clients. The subdued outlook took the gloss off another record year. Net income rose 17 percent to A$2.98 billion ($2.1 billion) in the 12 months ended March 31, the Sydney-based company said Friday. That was broadly in line with both the bank’s forecast of up to 15 percent growth, and analyst estimates of A$2.97 billion. The biggest boost last year came from the commodities and global markets division, where net income surged 65 percent, and Macquarie Capital, where profit jumped 89 percent, helped by the sale of Quadrant Energy. Even given the subdued outlook and today’s slide, Macquarie is leaving Australia’s big four commercial banks in its dust. Profit at the retail banks is taking a hit as they confront slowing credit growth and deal with the mounting cost of years of wrongdoing.Get MoreFor more details on the results, click hereTo contact the reporter on this story: Peter Vercoe in Sydney at pvercoe@bloomberg.netTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Katrina Nicholas at knicholas2@bloomberg.net, Angus Whitley, Adam HaighFor more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2019 Bloomberg L.P.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextVanguard Founder Jack Bogle's Investment Tips, 12 Years LaterBloombergU.S.-China Trade Deal Talks Enter Endgame: Global Economy WeekBloombergA $300 Billion Blowup Has Traders Bracing for War in WashingtonBloombergIran Hasn't Cut Offshore Oil Output, Halted Exports: IOOC HeadBloombergBuffett Slams Private Equity for Inflated Returns, Debt RelianceBloombergMaximum Security owner weighs options after disqualificationAssociated PressIn abrupt turn, Trump vows higher U.S. tariffs on China goodsReutersForget UPS: Here's Who's Really at Risk as Amazon Expands Its Shipping ReachMotley FoolGoogle's Pixel 3a XL Spotted in the WildInvestorPlaceThis is one of the most luxurious gyms in the U.S.Yahoo Finance VideoWelly, Method founder looks to traditional retail to boost band aid salesYahoo FinanceMunger: Bitcoin investors celebrate 'Judas Iscariot' at their happy hoursYahoo FinanceDisney World and Disneyland Survive Bans on Smoking and Large StrollersMotley FoolWhy Berkshire Hathaway is 'so very peculiar,' according to Charlie MungerYahoo FinanceDid You Manage To Avoid Universal Electronics's (NASDAQ:UEIC) 40% Share Price Drop?Simply Wall St.Berkshire Hathaway's business meeting and Yahoo Finance's aftershowYahoo Finance VideoForget royal weddings: The US is the most expensive place to get hitchedYahoo FinanceWill Disney Increase Hotel Rates When Star Wars Land Opens?Motley FoolWATCH: 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingYahoo Finance VideoKim oversees missile firing drills, tells troops to be alertAssociated PressMan credited with calling the 2008 crisis says the next 20 years in the stock market will 'break a lot of hearts'MarketWatchBuffett on Tesla, selling cars onlineYahoo Finance VideoCBS has a 'white problem': former executiveYahoo FinanceBerkshire Hathaway Q1 earnings grow, but Kraft Heinz is missingYahoo FinanceBerkshire's Buffett, Munger on succession plansYahoo Finance VideoWarren Buffett: I'm a 'card-carrying capitalist,' rejects US embrace of socialismYahoo FinanceA Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Proto Labs, Inc.
