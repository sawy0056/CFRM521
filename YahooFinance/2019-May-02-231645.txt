And Zac, for a certain demographic, he’s a guy who can do no wrong because of how he looks and how he acts…he’s just this persona that people admire and that’s exactly the effect Bundy had on people.”Though the film has received high praise on the film festival circuit, not everyone believes Netflix films should receive awards consideration. Famed director Steven Spielberg said recently that films not in theaters should not be considered for Oscar awards. Berlinger disagrees.“I made a film called ‘Paradise Lost’ that was nominated for both an Oscar and an Emmy, so I benefitted from that system, but I think that the filmmaker needs to decide is it a film or is it a television show,” Berlinger said. “How one sees it shouldn’t determine whether something is cinematic or not.”Devin Southard is a producer at Yahoo Finance.Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, LinkedIn, and reddit.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHow Did Netflix Stock Fare in April?Market RealistApple on Track to Hit 500 Million Paid Subscriptions Next YearMotley FoolYour Weekend Reading: Warren Buffett's Big DayBloombergHere's What Happened Before the Story Told in 'Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile'EsquireRyan Murphy Relists Lavish Laguna Beach CompoundVarietyMaximum Security owner weighs options after disqualificationAssociated PressIn abrupt turn, Trump vows higher U.S. tariffs on China goodsReutersForget UPS: Here's Who's Really at Risk as Amazon Expands Its Shipping ReachMotley FoolHow Netflix Makes MoneyInvestopediaThis is one of the most luxurious gyms in the U.S.Yahoo Finance VideoWelly, Method founder looks to traditional retail to boost band aid salesYahoo FinanceMunger: Bitcoin investors celebrate 'Judas Iscariot' at their happy hoursYahoo FinanceDisney World and Disneyland Survive Bans on Smoking and Large StrollersMotley FoolWhy Berkshire Hathaway is 'so very peculiar,' according to Charlie MungerYahoo FinanceYour Domino's pizza may soon be delivered by a robotCoin RivetBerkshire Hathaway's business meeting and Yahoo Finance's aftershowYahoo Finance VideoForget royal weddings: The US is the most expensive place to get hitchedYahoo FinanceWill Disney Increase Hotel Rates When Star Wars Land Opens?Motley FoolWATCH: 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingYahoo Finance VideoKim oversees missile firing drills, tells troops to be alertAssociated PressPodcasting Is Suddenly Hot And Spotify, Others Want To Feast On ItInvestor's Business DailyBerkshire's Buffett on portfolio strategyYahoo Finance VideoCBS has a 'white problem': former executiveYahoo FinanceBerkshire Hathaway Q1 earnings grow, but Kraft Heinz is missingYahoo FinanceVanguard Founder Jack Bogle's Investment Tips, 12 Years LaterBloombergBerkshire's Buffett, Munger on succession plansYahoo Finance VideoSinemia Shuts Its U.S. Operations; Will AMC's Stubs A-List Be Next?Motley FoolBuffett on See's Candy growth strategyYahoo Finance VideoHighlights from the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting: Morning BriefYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett: I'm a 'card-carrying capitalist,' rejects US embrace of socialismYahoo FinanceU.S Mortgages – Mortgage Rates Fall for the 1st Time in 4-WeeksFX EmpireCharlie Munger: 'If you want one mantra, it comes from' Singapore's first prime ministerYahoo Finance
