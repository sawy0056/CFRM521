Current managers also need to apply for new roles such as business leads, team leads and academy trainers. And the new plan will provide lower-ranking staffers with training, additional support from their managers and better recognition for good work.Store managers will remain on the top of the structure, with newly created "business leads" ranked under them and "team leads" next in the hierarchy. Business lead salaries will be 10% higher than what assistant store managers currently make and team leads will receive a starting salary of $18 an hour.These changes come after Walmart has endured decades of criticism from labor rights activists and lawsuits tied to its treatment of workers.More From CNBC Beyond Meat CEO: We're focused on the meat industry, not other vegetarian optionsStarbucks is speeding up innovation at its Seattle research hubBeyond Meat surges 135% in its IPO debutReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWhy Amazon's Willing to Spend Billions on Next-Day ShippingMotley FoolWhen Screening For Top Stocks, Don't Forget The 'New' In CAN SLIMInvestor's Business DailyConference seeks to boost collaboration on clean energy issuesAmerican City Business JournalsI've tested just about every weird cleaning product — here are the 10 that were truly life-changingYahoo LifestyleAmazon device sale, plus deals on Apple Watch, Oral-B Pro 6000, Bose QuietComfort 35, and more for May 5MashableMaximum Security owner weighs options after disqualificationAssociated PressIn abrupt turn, Trump vows higher U.S. tariffs on China goodsReutersForget UPS: Here's Who's Really at Risk as Amazon Expands Its Shipping ReachMotley FoolNordstrom Local Service Hubs Are Coming to NYCMotley FoolThis is one of the most luxurious gyms in the U.S.Yahoo Finance VideoWelly, Method founder looks to traditional retail to boost band aid salesYahoo FinanceMunger: Bitcoin investors celebrate 'Judas Iscariot' at their happy hoursYahoo FinanceDisney World and Disneyland Survive Bans on Smoking and Large StrollersMotley FoolWhy Berkshire Hathaway is 'so very peculiar,' according to Charlie MungerYahoo FinanceBuffett's Berkshire turns loss into $21bn profit - but Kraft Heinz numbers missingThe TelegraphBerkshire Hathaway's business meeting and Yahoo Finance's aftershowYahoo Finance VideoForget royal weddings: The US is the most expensive place to get hitchedYahoo FinanceWill Disney Increase Hotel Rates When Star Wars Land Opens?Motley FoolWATCH: 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingYahoo Finance VideoKim oversees missile firing drills, tells troops to be alertAssociated PressBoeing says safety review corroborated its findings on a 737 MAX sensorReutersBuffett on Tesla, selling cars onlineYahoo Finance VideoCBS has a 'white problem': former executiveYahoo FinanceBerkshire Hathaway Q1 earnings grow, but Kraft Heinz is missingYahoo FinanceVanguard Founder Jack Bogle's Investment Tips, 12 Years LaterBloombergBerkshire's Buffett, Munger on succession plansYahoo Finance Video3 Stocks to Build Your Portfolio AroundMotley FoolBerkshire's Buffett on portfolio strategyYahoo Finance VideoHighlights from the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting: Morning BriefYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett: I'm a 'card-carrying capitalist,' rejects US embrace of socialismYahoo FinanceU.S Mortgages – Mortgage Rates Fall for the 1st Time in 4-WeeksFX EmpireCharlie Munger: 'If you want one mantra, it comes from' Singapore's first prime ministerYahoo Finance
