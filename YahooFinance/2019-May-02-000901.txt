REUTERS/Yves Herman/File PhotoBy William JamesLONDON (Reuters) - English voters are expected to use local government elections on Thursday to punish Prime Minister Theresa May's Conservative Party over its failure to deliver Brexit, revealing a divided and dissatisfied electorate.More than 8,000 seats on English councils - administrative bodies responsible for day-to-day decisions on local policy ranging from education to waste management - are up for grabs in the first elections since Britain missed its March 29 Brexit date.The results will paint a picture, albeit an imperfect one, of how that has affected support for May's center-right Conservative Party, and the leftist opposition Labour Party.The Conservatives are forecast to lose hundreds of seats, and, according to one analysis, the final toll could top 1,000. Labour, which rejects May's vision of Brexit but still supports leaving the bloc, are expected to make gains, as are the anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats.That would heap more pressure on May to resign, showing that the deep dissatisfaction with her handling of Britain's EU exit extends beyond party members into the wider population, angering both those who want to leave and those who want to stay."Never did I think a time would exist where I’d get abuse from Conservatives for telling Conservatives to vote for Conservatives, but here we are," said Stephen Canning a local councillor campaigning for the Conservatives in a pro-Brexit part of south-east England.BREXIT DEADLOCKMay has been unable to persuade parliament to approve her plan for leaving the EU, forcing her to ask Brussels to extend Britain's membership until October. She has turned to Labour in search of a compromise that could get enough support, but how, when, and even if, Britain will leave the EU remains unclear.The first results are due to be released in the hours after polling closes at 2100 GMT on Thursday.Robert Hayward, a polling specialist and former Conservative lawmaker, said he expected the Conservatives to lose more than 800 seats, Labour to gain fewer than 300 and the Liberal Democrats to pick up more than 500.Another analysis by academics Colin Rallings and Michael Thrasher suggested that a swing in polling toward Labour could translate into Conservative losses of more than 1,000 seats and 800 Labour gains.Local elections are historically seen as an imperfect proxy for national sentiment because turnout is low, they do not cover every area of the country, and can be narrowly focused on local issues such as street lighting and refuse collection.Council elections take place in yearly batches across England. There are also some local elections taking place in Northern Ireland on Thursday but none in Wales and Scotland, which operate under a different schedule.The English seats being contested on Thursday were last up for grabs when the Conservatives were riding high in 2015, on the same day as May's predecessor David Cameron won the party's first majority in parliament for 23 years."A fall from that level is therefore inevitable at some stage and it will come this year - with force," Hayward said.(Reporting by William James; Editing by Gareth Jones)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextLocal elections deliver Brexit bashing for Britain's May and oppositionReutersLabour's John McDonnell says he has no trust in PM as he accuses her of betraying Brexit talksEvening StandardLib Dems to press for tougher EU-wide commitment to curb climate change if Brexit stoppedThe IndependentBrexit: Labour backlash scuppers Theresa May's hopes of cross-party dealThe IndependentBrexit deal prospects in doubt in 'bad faith' spatAFPMaximum Security owner weighs options after disqualificationAssociated PressIn abrupt turn, Trump vows higher U.S. tariffs on China goodsReutersForget UPS: Here's Who's Really at Risk as Amazon Expands Its Shipping ReachMotley FoolCan a Divorced Woman Collect Social Security from Her Ex-Husband?InvestopediaThis is one of the most luxurious gyms in the U.S.Yahoo Finance VideoWelly, Method founder looks to traditional retail to boost band aid salesYahoo FinanceMunger: Bitcoin investors celebrate 'Judas Iscariot' at their happy hoursYahoo FinanceDisney World and Disneyland Survive Bans on Smoking and Large StrollersMotley FoolWhy Berkshire Hathaway is 'so very peculiar,' according to Charlie MungerYahoo FinanceThe Downside of Low UnemploymentInvestopediaBerkshire Hathaway's business meeting and Yahoo Finance's aftershowYahoo Finance VideoForget royal weddings: The US is the most expensive place to get hitchedYahoo FinanceWill Disney Increase Hotel Rates When Star Wars Land Opens?Motley FoolWATCH: 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingYahoo Finance VideoKim oversees missile firing drills, tells troops to be alertAssociated PressHere's What You're Missing About Joe Biden's Stance on MarijuanaMotley FoolBerkshire's Buffett on portfolio strategyYahoo Finance VideoCBS has a 'white problem': former executiveYahoo FinanceBerkshire Hathaway Q1 earnings grow, but Kraft Heinz is missingYahoo FinanceVanguard Founder Jack Bogle's Investment Tips, 12 Years LaterBloombergBerkshire's Buffett, Munger on succession plansYahoo Finance VideoThis Social Security Prediction Will Be Proved Wrong in 2019Motley FoolBuffett on See's Candy growth strategyYahoo Finance VideoHighlights from the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting: Morning BriefYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett: I'm a 'card-carrying capitalist,' rejects US embrace of socialismYahoo FinanceU.S Mortgages – Mortgage Rates Fall for the 1st Time in 4-WeeksFX EmpireCharlie Munger: 'If you want one mantra, it comes from' Singapore's first prime ministerYahoo Finance
