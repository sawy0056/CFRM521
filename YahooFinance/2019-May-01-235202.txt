A top team owner says there's one key to the whole thingAnnie PeiCNBCMay 1, 2019ReblogShareTweetShareAs esports becomes a bigger buzzword among Wall Street analysts, a top team owner says potential investors should focus on one key factor: Who builds community best?Sponsorships and brand deals are projected to bring in more than a third of total revenue for the industry this year, according to research firm Newzoo. But Steve Arhancet, owner and CEO of Team Liquid, an esports organization whose parent group includes the likes of former Sony executive Peter Guber and Washington Capitals owner Ted Leonsis, says the main driver of revenue in esports will ultimately come from businesses that are centered around the fan."That is what will eventually drive revenues," he told CNBC. "You want to be able to invest in [companies and brands] that can generate substantial revenue in [the] future, so ask yourself: Who owns that fan relationship?""You can say that the gamer is playing the game and they have developed [a] relationship with the game, but I would argue that the teams have the biggest arsenal to create that relationship and drive revenue per capita," he argued.Esports enthusiasts, which Newzoo uses to define a person who watches professional esports content more than once a month, are set to bring in around $5.45 in revenue per capita this year, according to the research firm. This represents an increase of about 9% from 2018. This increase in revenue per capita is also taking place during a year where the total esports audience is projected to grow to almost 454 million, which Newzoo notes is a year-on-year growth of 15% based on their numbers.About 201 million of those audience members are projected to be the esports enthusiasts that Newzoo has identified.But Arhancet says that many revenue projections are missing two key elements that hinge on community and fanbase-building.First, he points out that revenue estimates often fail to account for how much developers earn on in-game purchases related to esports events versus sales from the event itself. For example, Riot Games, the publisher behind League of Legends, has released special skins (different outfits for in-game characters) or used already-existing in-game purchases to add to prize pools for some of their major events.Others also rely on in-game purchases to fund their event prize pools like publisher Valve's Defense of the Ancients 2 (DotA 2), which broke its own prize pool record with over $25.5 million raised for its annual The International tournament last year.Additionally, Arhancet believes that community-building will fuel the growth of what is projected to be the second-biggest revenue generator for esports: Media rights deals.A number of prominent media deals have already appeared in esports. For instance, last year Disney inked a partnership with Activision Blizzard ATVI 's Overwatch League to broadcast their games on a variety of Disney's platforms. Twitch and Facebook FB have also snagged a number of deals with prominent leagues in the space.Arhancet argues that media companies — including digital platforms like Twitch — will need to evolve in order to meet the demands of a growing esports fanbase. Specifically, he believes they will have to shift away from traditional linear programming in favor of a more interactive viewing experience."[When you watch League of Legends, for example], you're not just watching the game," he said. "You're also watching the chat, having conversations and pushing emotes while you watch. That's pushing additional requirements on digital networks to become more communities than just streaming services."The esports industry is projected to hit over $1 billion in revenue this year.More From CNBC Watch CNBC's interview with investor Chamath PalihapitiyaClick HERE to submit your question for the traders!We don't need FAANG stocks to carry the market higher, says portfolio managerReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHow Does Fortnite Make Money?InvestopediaRichie Keen To Direct Will Ferrell In eSports Comedy At LegendaryDeadlineMaximum Security owner weighs options after disqualificationAssociated PressIn abrupt turn, Trump vows higher U.S. tariffs on China goodsReutersForget UPS: Here's Who's Really at Risk as Amazon Expands Its Shipping ReachMotley FoolThis is one of the most luxurious gyms in the U.S.Yahoo Finance VideoWelly, Method founder looks to traditional retail to boost band aid salesYahoo FinanceMunger: Bitcoin investors celebrate 'Judas Iscariot' at their happy hoursYahoo FinanceDisney World and Disneyland Survive Bans on Smoking and Large StrollersMotley FoolWhy Berkshire Hathaway is 'so very peculiar,' according to Charlie MungerYahoo FinanceBerkshire Hathaway's business meeting and Yahoo Finance's aftershowYahoo Finance VideoForget royal weddings: The US is the most expensive place to get hitchedYahoo FinanceWill Disney Increase Hotel Rates When Star Wars Land Opens?Motley FoolWATCH: 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingYahoo Finance VideoKim oversees missile firing drills, tells troops to be alertAssociated PressBuffett on Tesla, selling cars onlineYahoo Finance VideoCBS has a 'white problem': former executiveYahoo FinanceBerkshire Hathaway Q1 earnings grow, but Kraft Heinz is missingYahoo FinanceVanguard Founder Jack Bogle's Investment Tips, 12 Years LaterBloombergBerkshire's Buffett, Munger on succession plansYahoo Finance VideoBerkshire's Buffett on portfolio strategyYahoo Finance VideoHighlights from the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting: Morning BriefYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett: I'm a 'card-carrying capitalist,' rejects US embrace of socialismYahoo FinanceU.S Mortgages – Mortgage Rates Fall for the 1st Time in 4-WeeksFX EmpireCharlie Munger: 'If you want one mantra, it comes from' Singapore's first prime ministerYahoo FinanceBuffett on See's Candy growth strategyYahoo Finance VideoBuffett and Munger sound off on Brexit at Berkshire meeting: 'horrible' and 'a mistake'Yahoo FinanceHere's how much money the winning jockey at the Kentucky Derby will earnCNBCThe TurboTax scandal provides a key lesson about tax preparersYahoo Finance
