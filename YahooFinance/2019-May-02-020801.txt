That's according to a new report from Kyriba on currency losses quantified during quarterly earnings calls. The firm counsels companies on financial risk and compliance. That figure is up $9 billion from the prior quarter and the highest since Q4 2015.The average EPS impact reported by North American companies was $0.05, according to the report. That's up 25 percent from the third quarter and the highest EPS hit from currencies since Q2 2016. Around 300 North American companies quantified negative currency impacts during their fourth quarter earnings calls, a 14 percent increase from the quarter before.A strong dollar can create headwinds for U.S. companies reporting earnings from abroad. When foreign currencies are comparatively weak against the greenback, it takes more to buy U.S. dollars when translated into the home currency. The actual impact of foreign exchange is likely higher, as companies aren't required to report currency losses. Many companies report their revenue in "constant currency" alongside unadjusted figures.The report cited medical equipment and biotechnology as two of the most-impacted industries, partly due to ongoing trade tensions between the U.S. and China."The impact of North American headwinds represents the most significant currency hit to top-line revenue in the last 12 quarters," said Wolfgang Koester, chief strategist for Kyriba. "The ongoing U.S.-China trade war as well as other geopolitical events such as Brexit have had the greatest negative impact on currency holdings."On the other side of the Atlantic, European companies saw a comparative decrease in negative currency impacts in the fourth quarter. Companies reported $3.1 billion in currency value loss, down from $3.8 billion in the third quarter and $22.9 billion in Q1 2018.The report included analysis of earnings calls from 1,200 publicly traded companies from North America and Europe doing business in more than one currency and with at least 15 percent of their revenue coming from overseas.More From CNBC Top News and AnalysisLatest News VideoPersonal FinanceReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextUnder Armour's turnaround is under way, and analysts encourage investors to buy nowMarketWatchGM Is in Good Shape After Solid Q1 ResultsMotley FoolNovo Nordisk A/S (NVO) Q1 2019 Earnings Call TranscriptMotley FoolTransCanada Generates Record Earnings in Q1Motley Fool'Avengers' blast past 'Titanic' to all-time No. 2AFPMaximum Security owner weighs options after disqualificationAssociated PressIn abrupt turn, Trump vows higher U.S. tariffs on China goodsReutersForget UPS: Here's Who's Really at Risk as Amazon Expands Its Shipping ReachMotley FoolGoogle's Pixel 3a XL Spotted in the WildInvestorPlaceThis is one of the most luxurious gyms in the U.S.Yahoo Finance VideoWelly, Method founder looks to traditional retail to boost band aid salesYahoo FinanceMunger: Bitcoin investors celebrate 'Judas Iscariot' at their happy hoursYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett on what he values most in life: 'It's the two things you can't buy'Yahoo FinanceDisney World and Disneyland Survive Bans on Smoking and Large StrollersMotley FoolWhy This Little-Known Marijuana Stock Soared 25% in AprilMotley FoolBerkshire Hathaway's business meeting and Yahoo Finance's aftershowYahoo Finance VideoForget royal weddings: The US is the most expensive place to get hitchedYahoo FinanceWhy Berkshire Hathaway is 'so very peculiar,' according to Charlie MungerYahoo FinanceWill Disney Increase Hotel Rates When Star Wars Land Opens?Motley FoolWATCH: 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingYahoo Finance VideoDid You Manage To Avoid Universal Electronics's (NASDAQ:UEIC) 40% Share Price Drop?Simply Wall St.Berkshire's Buffett on portfolio strategyYahoo Finance VideoHighlights from the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting: Morning BriefYahoo FinanceKim oversees missile firing drills, tells troops to be alertAssociated PressBerkshire Hathaway Q1 earnings grow, but Kraft Heinz is missingYahoo FinanceVanguard Founder Jack Bogle's Investment Tips, 12 Years LaterBloombergMan credited with calling the 2008 crisis says the next 20 years in the stock market will 'break a lot of hearts'MarketWatchBuffett on See's Candy growth strategyYahoo Finance VideoBerkshire's Buffett, Munger on succession plansYahoo Finance VideoWarren Buffett: I'm a 'card-carrying capitalist,' rejects US embrace of socialismYahoo FinanceU.S Mortgages – Mortgage Rates Fall for the 1st Time in 4-WeeksFX EmpireA Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Proto Labs, Inc.
