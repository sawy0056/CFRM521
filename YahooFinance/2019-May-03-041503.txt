The reason is that Buffett was always kind of around during my 29-year tenure at Fortune Magazine, which began in 1985. By being around I mean that Buffett, mostly through his friendship with one of my mentors, legendary journalist Carol Loomis, would stop by our offices, or attend a Fortune event or meet some of us at a nearby hotel for a Coke. (All those years, and I don’t remember him drinking anything else.)Early on for me, Buffett was kind of like a distant workplace uncle.By the mid-1990s, we had talked a few times briefly, and by late that decade I had interviewed him a little bit. But I’m pretty sure the first time I really sat down with for an extended period was some 17 years ago over a weekend at Pebble Beach on a golf outing with Don Graham, the former CEO of the Washington Post, among others. It was for a cover story on him that I wrote and that was in fact memorable.Buffett was and is, to use a phrase I heard him employ about others (including George W. Bush), “comfortable in his own skin.” He was relaxed, and in his PJs, and we spoke for hours in his cabana-like room right off the sixth green.An investor with a high ‘emotional quotient’What is like to talk to Warren Buffett? I would have to say super enjoyable. You might have expected me to say how smart he is, and of course he is, but the first thing I would say about him is that he has a very high EQ, or emotional quotient. Buffett is warm, very funny and is genuinely interested in finding out about you. He is thoughtful and self-aware. I would say he is as good with people as he is with business. And of course one is connected with the other.Warren Buffett speaks to Yahoo Finance's editor-in-chief, Andy Serwer.MoreI quickly discovered that you could, and wanted to talk to Buffett about things way beyond investing and markets. His take on just about everything under the sun was and is always must-hear stuff — including his observations on politics, history, famous people, sports, and news. Sure, he has his limits. He’s not an aficionado of rap or JavaScript. But contract bridge? Forget about it.After that cover story, we spoke from time to time. I wrote more stories about him and what he thinks of the markets, and his partner Charlie Munger and smaller pieces for my column, Streetlife/Captain’s Blog. (Nice pic of Warren and Obama in this one.) 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingMoreWhen I became editor of the magazine in 2006, I would fly out to Omaha to have lunch with him once a year. And I still sit down with him annually now that I am at Yahoo Finance. It’s been most generous of him to give me all those hours. Time of course is his most precious resource, and let’s just say at 88, his supply isn’t exactly increasing.I’ve done a number of fun interviews since I’ve been at Yahoo, like this one where he said good habits may be more important than IQ or here where he said that there comes a point where money “has no real utility.” Or this year’s interview where he said that “All you have to do is just buy a cross-section of America and then never listen to people like me or read the papers or do anything subsequently.”Sometimes what he says is a bit repetitive. So be it. I’ll tell you this, I’ve never come away from talking with him without learning something important.An imperfect but exceptional AmericanTo be clear, there are many more people much closer to Buffett than I am. I just know him a bit, but you do get a pretty good sense of someone over a couple decades. (The aforementioned Carol Loomis is particularly close. I once walked into her office years ago and asked her something about Buffett. She said, “Hmm, I don’t know. Let’s find out.” She picked up the phone and dialed a number. “Hey,” she said into the phone. And then she asked the question to the man himself.)Story continuesYahoo Finance's editor-in-chief, Andy Serwer, speaks to Warren Buffett.MoreThere are a few people who don’t like Buffett so much. They harp on his mistakes (like owning IBM stock), or they think he’s a hypocrite or just stupid for owning Wells Fargo (WFC) and Kraft Heinz (KHC) shares. Some don’t like his politics, (pro-business, liberal), or find him sanctimonious when waxing on about taxes or corporate governance. (By the way, these people really don’t bother him.)Ok so, a) Buffett’s not perfect and b), yes, he’s a businessman. After we have that out of the way, I would submit that Buffett ranks pretty dang high on a list of exceptional Americans, or citizens of the world for that matter. Not only is Buffett the greatest investor of our time, but he sets a standard for business leaders as well. And he gives a huge amount of his time to teaching, explaining and sharing his wisdom, not just to shareholders and executives but to thousands of students.And then there’s his generosity—and his philanthropic fundraising which is really unparalleled. Buffett along with Bill and Melinda Gates founded The Giving Pledge which is “an effort to help address society’s most pressing problems by inviting the world’s wealthiest individuals and families to commit more than half of their wealth to philanthropy or charitable causes either during their lifetime or in their will.”Buffettt has pledged to give away almost all of his $80 billion fortune. And he and the Gateses have personally rallied some 190 of the richest people on the planet (mostly billionaires) to do so, as well. (Buffett’s philanthropy of choice is the Gates Foundation, because he thinks it can do a better job giving away his money than he can. It’s sort of like “I’m good at making money, my buddy’s foundation is good at figuring out what to do with it.”)So you can take pot shots at Buffett. You can take pot shots at anybody. But to me it makes a whole lot more sense to listen to what the man has to say.You never know, you just might learn something. I know I will.Andy Serwer is editor-in-chief of Yahoo Finance.More on Warren Buffett:11 Warren Buffett quotes that will make you a smarter investorWarren Buffett carries an American Express cards and about $400 in cashThis will be Warren Buffett’s greatest legacyReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextDid You Manage To Avoid Universal Electronics's (NASDAQ:UEIC) 40% Share Price Drop?Simply Wall St.Buffett and Munger sound off on Brexit at Berkshire meeting: 'horrible' and 'a mistake'Yahoo FinanceWarren Buffett bashes Bitcoin again, labels it a 'gambling device'Coin RivetBuffett's Berkshire turns loss into $21bn profit - but Kraft Heinz numbers missingThe TelegraphHere Are Warren Buffett's Best Stock Picks Since The Last Berkshire Hathaway MeetingFortuneMaximum Security owner weighs options after disqualificationAssociated PressIn abrupt turn, Trump vows higher U.S. tariffs on China goodsReutersForget UPS: Here's Who's Really at Risk as Amazon Expands Its Shipping ReachMotley FoolTrump's tariffs could knock Tesla's Autopilot off courseTechCrunchThis is one of the most luxurious gyms in the U.S.Yahoo Finance VideoWelly, Method founder looks to traditional retail to boost band aid salesYahoo FinanceMunger: Bitcoin investors celebrate 'Judas Iscariot' at their happy hoursYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett on what he values most in life: 'It's the two things you can't buy'Yahoo FinanceDisney World and Disneyland Survive Bans on Smoking and Large StrollersMotley FoolActivision Blizzard Gunned Down By Soft Sales, Earnings GuidanceInvestor's Business DailyBerkshire Hathaway's business meeting and Yahoo Finance's aftershowYahoo Finance VideoForget royal weddings: The US is the most expensive place to get hitchedYahoo FinanceWhy Berkshire Hathaway is 'so very peculiar,' according to Charlie MungerYahoo FinanceWill Disney Increase Hotel Rates When Star Wars Land Opens?Motley FoolWATCH: 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingYahoo Finance VideoSpotify's leanback instant listening app Stations hits iOSTechCrunchBerkshire's Buffett on portfolio strategyYahoo Finance VideoHighlights from the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting: Morning BriefYahoo FinanceKim oversees missile firing drills, tells troops to be alertAssociated PressBerkshire Hathaway Q1 earnings grow, but Kraft Heinz is missingYahoo FinanceVanguard Founder Jack Bogle's Investment Tips, 12 Years LaterBloombergFed up Canada tells U.S. to help with China crisis or forget about favorsReutersBuffett on See's Candy growth strategyYahoo Finance VideoBerkshire's Buffett, Munger on succession plansYahoo Finance VideoWarren Buffett: I'm a 'card-carrying capitalist,' rejects US embrace of socialismYahoo FinanceU.S Mortgages – Mortgage Rates Fall for the 1st Time in 4-WeeksFX EmpireWeek-in-Review: the iPhone fades and SpaceX confirms an explosionTechCrunch
