The U.S. market accounts for about half of the company's total revenue.Chief Executive Officer David Hoffmann said the U.S. growth was the largest quarterly comparable store sales increase in four years."I think we made some good investments in 2018," Hoffmann said in an interview, referring to its coffee line-up.Dunkin' also sold more donuts in the quarter, even as consumers shy away from sugary snacks."In terms of any of those health concerns, we haven't seen it show up for us," Hoffmann said.The chain's international business also showed strong results, driven by strength in the Middle-East, South-East Asia and Australia.However, Baskin-Robbins, the company's ice-cream chain, continues to struggle. Sales in U.S. stores open for at least an year fell 2.8 percent, partly hurt by a cold winter. International sales also dropped.Still, total revenue rose about 6 percent to $319.1 million, beating expectations of $312.5 million.Net income rose to $52.3 million, or 63 cents per share, in the three months ended March 30 from $50.2 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding one-time items, the company earned 67 cents, beating analysts' average estimate by 5 cents.The company's shares are up about 17 percent this year including Thursday's gains.
