According to the National Center of Education Statistics, the employment rate for people between 25 and 34 years old with bachelor’s degrees was 86%. Employers plan to hire almost 11% more new graduates from the current class than from previous years, according to a survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers.“It’s a candidate's market—we've had low unemployment, so candidates have a choice as to where they want to work,” says Paul Wolfe, senior vice president at Indeed.And students should be applying for jobs now. “You don’t have to wait until you’re finished at school,” he says. “A lot of companies will hire you knowing that you’ve got a graduation date a month from now.”Be diligent in your job searchIt’s critical to do your research when it comes to finding a job that will be a good fit. Wolfe recommends treating the job search like a full-time job.“You should spend a good chunk of your day focused on that and not just randomly doing it,” Wolfe says.Spend time researching companies that interest you and fit your goals. Then make sure you tailor your resume to match the job description. Wolfe also recommends connecting with your contacts and networking.Consider freelance workWhile many grads have their sights set on a full-time position, Wolfe says it’s important to consider the gig economy as a good place to test the waters.“The gig economy is good if you’re not certain what industry to get into or what type of role you want to get into,” he says. “This way you won’t realize four or five months into it that you really don't like it.”Additionally, getting freelance or part-time jobs could add up to a similar salary as a more permanent gig, and you get the flexibility of exploring different opportunities, Wolfe says.Be patientOnce you’ve started your job, it’s important to couch your expectations, Wolfe says.“During your first job, you're not going to know everything walking in the door, especially if you've just graduated college,” he says. “We've all been in that spot before where it's our first job and were a little freaked out by it, but I would not put a ton of pressure on yourself to know every answer right out of the gate.”Use your early days on the job to get to know your coworkers and learn about the company culture. Ask plenty of questions so you understand the expectations from the beginning. This can help you avoid feeling stuck a few months in, Wolfe says.Plan an exit strategy if it’s not a fitIf you’re unhappy at your new position and already want an out, Wolfe recommends looking at what is making you unhappy and understanding if there are ways to make it work before you jump ship. While he used to tell people to wait six months to a year before leaving a job, Wolfe says he’s reconsidered.I think if you really don't like it and you've done everything you can to try and make it work, leave,” he says. “The line between work and life is blurred today because of technology, and so you've really got to enjoy what you do.”Use the time you were working before on a new job search and stay focused on finding your next opportunity.“Your career is a long game. It's an evolution,” Wolfe says.WATCH MORE Why college grads moving back home should pay rent3 tips to score a job before graduation3 money mistakes to avoid after graduating collegeReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMaximum Security owner weighs options after disqualificationAssociated PressIn abrupt turn, Trump vows higher U.S. tariffs on China goodsReutersForget UPS: Here's Who's Really at Risk as Amazon Expands Its Shipping ReachMotley FoolThis couple is one year away from having enough money to retire early — here's what they didMarketWatchThis is one of the most luxurious gyms in the U.S.Yahoo Finance VideoWelly, Method founder looks to traditional retail to boost band aid salesYahoo FinanceMunger: Bitcoin investors celebrate 'Judas Iscariot' at their happy hoursYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett on what he values most in life: 'It's the two things you can't buy'Yahoo FinanceDisney World and Disneyland Survive Bans on Smoking and Large StrollersMotley FoolBoeing says safety review corroborated its findings on a 737 MAX sensorReutersBerkshire Hathaway's business meeting and Yahoo Finance's aftershowYahoo Finance VideoForget royal weddings: The US is the most expensive place to get hitchedYahoo FinanceWhy Berkshire Hathaway is 'so very peculiar,' according to Charlie MungerYahoo FinanceWill Disney Increase Hotel Rates When Star Wars Land Opens?Motley FoolWATCH: 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingYahoo Finance Video3 Stocks to Build Your Portfolio AroundMotley FoolBerkshire's Buffett on portfolio strategyYahoo Finance VideoHighlights from the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting: Morning BriefYahoo FinanceKim oversees missile firing drills, tells troops to be alertAssociated PressBerkshire Hathaway Q1 earnings grow, but Kraft Heinz is missingYahoo FinanceVanguard Founder Jack Bogle's Investment Tips, 12 Years LaterBloombergA Tequila Sommelier on How to Drink Mexico's Favorite SpiritFortuneBuffett on See's Candy growth strategyYahoo Finance VideoBuffett and Munger sound off on Brexit at Berkshire meeting: 'horrible' and 'a mistake'Yahoo FinanceBerkshire's Buffett, Munger on succession plansYahoo Finance VideoWarren Buffett: I'm a 'card-carrying capitalist,' rejects US embrace of socialismYahoo FinanceU.S Mortgages – Mortgage Rates Fall for the 1st Time in 4-WeeksFX EmpireActivision Blizzard Gunned Down By Soft Sales, Earnings GuidanceInvestor's Business DailyBuffett on Berkshire's risk model: There's no formulaYahoo Finance VideoCBS has a 'white problem': former executiveYahoo FinanceCharlie Munger: 'If you want one mantra, it comes from' Singapore's first prime ministerYahoo Finance
