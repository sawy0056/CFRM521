The Fed, however, noted that economic activity “rose at a solid rate” during the first quarter.On Friday, the Bureau of Economic Analysis announced that the economy had grown at a 3.2% annualized rate in the first three months of the year, which surged well-past expectations for 2.3% growth for the first quarter.Powell said in Wednesday’s press conference that the 3.2% print showed slower growth in private consumption and business fixed investment, but expects both components to “bounce back” and contribute to “healthy GDP growth” over the rest of the year.Yet the Fed’s projections for GDP growth for 2019, released in its March meeting, suggested that GDP growth would come in at 2.1% for the year.In saying that there are no signs of overheating, Powell pointed to low inflation. Readings of core personal consumption expenditures - the Fed’s most preferred measure of inflation - prices rose by only 1.6% in March. That figure is well short of the Fed’s stated inflation target of 2%.Federal Reserve Board Chair Jerome Powell speaks at a news conference following a two-day meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, Wednesday, May 1, 2019, in Washington.
