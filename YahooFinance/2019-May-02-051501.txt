The event, which will emanate from the King Abdullah Sports City Stadium in Jeddah, will feature WWE stars of the past and present. “WWE Superstars” Roman Reigns, Undertaker, Kofi Kingston, Braun Strowman, Seth Rollins, Goldberg, AJ Styles, and Brock Lesnar are all scheduled to be a part of the event which will stream live on the WWE network. The June 7 event will be the first time the WWE will hold a show in Saudi Arabia since the controversial “Crown Jewel” event which took place on November 2, 2018.“Crown Jewel” sparked controversy because it was held just weeks after the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. Many have accused Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman as being the orchestrator of the killing, since the journalist had been a critic of Saudi Arabia’s ruling monarchy. In response, many companies and captains of industry distanced themselves from the Kingdom — but not WWE.Fans cheer during the WWE "Crown Jewel" World Cup 2018 tournament at King Saud University Stadium in Riyadh, November 2, 2018. REUTERS/Faisal al NasserMoreThe wrestling and entertainment giant chose to continue with the show due to a 10-year partnership with the Saudis as part of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s “Saudi Vision 2030” to broaden its economy. Despite some backlash by the likes of late-night talk show host John Oliver, the show was a success. In Q4 2018, WWE’s international revenue increased 58% to $318 million. That marked the first time in company history that international revenue surpassed the $300 million mark. Saudi shows like “Crown Jewel” and the earlier “Greatest Royal Rumble” played a big part in WWE reaching such lofty numbers.On April 7, the WWE held it’s record-breaking marquee event, WrestleMania, but on April 25 WWE’s Q1 earnings posted a surprising miss. WWE revenues were down in Q1 to the tune of $182.4 million, compared to $187.7 million in the prior year’s quarter. Operating income fell to $6.8 million compared to revenue of $21.8 million. WWE chairman and CEO Vince McMahon cited talent injuries for the earnings miss. During WWE’s latest earnings call McMahon said injured talent led to a decrease in live event attendance which led to the decline in merchandise sales.Following the announcement, shares of WWE were down 13%. In addition, WWE has also been experiencing a rating slide. On April 22, ratings for the company's flagship program “Monday Night Raw” dropped 11% from the prior week. It would be safe to say that the largest wrestling company in the world is looking toward the June 7 event in Saudi Arabia to help cure its post-WrestleMania hangover, along with a pair of mega TV deals with Fox and NBCU which take effect this fall that is worth over $1.2 billion.More from Reggie:WWE’s race to $1 billion starts with WrestleMania 35 'Showcase of the Immortals'WrestleMania smashes MetLife Stadium revenue recordHow Ronda Rousey is helping WWE crush it49ers player wore WWE-inspired cleats for a special fanFor the WWE, the future really is femaleReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextHas The Oil Rally Reached Its Limit?Oilprice.comAirbus considers legal action against Germany over Saudi ban: sourcesReutersATL Healthiest Employers: Humana Inc. employees embrace wellness effortsAmerican City Business JournalsAs protests demand civil rule, Sudan's Arab allies back generalsAFPAramco Cuts Oil Prices to U.S. as Trump Tightens Iran SanctionsBloombergMaximum Security owner weighs options after disqualificationAssociated PressIn abrupt turn, Trump vows higher U.S. tariffs on China goodsReutersForget UPS: Here's Who's Really at Risk as Amazon Expands Its Shipping ReachMotley FoolUnique bush sport draws Australia's top outback horseridersAFPThis is one of the most luxurious gyms in the U.S.Yahoo Finance VideoWelly, Method founder looks to traditional retail to boost band aid salesYahoo FinanceMunger: Bitcoin investors celebrate 'Judas Iscariot' at their happy hoursYahoo FinanceDisney World and Disneyland Survive Bans on Smoking and Large StrollersMotley FoolWhy Berkshire Hathaway is 'so very peculiar,' according to Charlie MungerYahoo FinanceThe Latest: Country House pays $132.40 to win at DerbyAssociated PressBerkshire Hathaway's business meeting and Yahoo Finance's aftershowYahoo Finance VideoForget royal weddings: The US is the most expensive place to get hitchedYahoo FinanceWill Disney Increase Hotel Rates When Star Wars Land Opens?Motley FoolWATCH: 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingYahoo Finance VideoKim oversees missile firing drills, tells troops to be alertAssociated PressEngland beats Pakistan by 7 wickets in T20, Archer impressesAssociated PressBuffett on Tesla, selling cars onlineYahoo Finance VideoCBS has a 'white problem': former executiveYahoo FinanceBerkshire Hathaway Q1 earnings grow, but Kraft Heinz is missingYahoo FinanceVanguard Founder Jack Bogle's Investment Tips, 12 Years LaterBloombergBerkshire's Buffett, Munger on succession plansYahoo Finance VideoKentucky Derby 2019: What Time It Starts, How to Watch, Odds-On FavoriteFortuneBerkshire's Buffett on portfolio strategyYahoo Finance VideoHighlights from the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting: Morning BriefYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett: I'm a 'card-carrying capitalist,' rejects US embrace of socialismYahoo FinanceU.S Mortgages – Mortgage Rates Fall for the 1st Time in 4-WeeksFX EmpireCharlie Munger: 'If you want one mantra, it comes from' Singapore's first prime ministerYahoo Finance
