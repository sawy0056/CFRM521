Obviously, this is just a small fraction of the total costs — just a piece.”Warren, a city that was once one of the nation's manufacturing hubs, has been struggling with high unemployment and a surge in opioid addiction.

According to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, the number of male opioid overdose deaths was at a rate of 4.4 per 100,000 individuals, compared to 1.6 of females, in 2000. By 2016, that number surged to 18.1 per 100,000 among men and 8.5 of females.Men has suffered more opioid overdose deaths than women.

And then there are the impacts on the ability to work, what additional services they may need, and whether they have interactions with the criminal justice system. This highlights that the opioid crisis affects people on different levels.”The federal government has recognized the broad impact of opioid addiction, so much so that President Donald Trump not only implemented legislation to tackle the crisis back in October 2018 but also declared it a public health emergency.President Donald Trump, left, introduces Customs and Border Patrol officers Long and Noble to speak during the RX Drug Abuse & Heroin Summit, Wednesday, April 24, 2019 in Atlanta.

He reiterated his administration’s commitment to combating the opioid epidemic, while tying it to his calls for a border wall and tougher immigration laws.Yahoo Finance previously reported on a recent study by the Cleveland Fed that looked at how national average opioid prescription rates affected labor force participation rates between 2000 and 2016. There were “substantial effects on prime age men and women.”However, other experts stressed that correlation did not necessarily equal causation.“While informative, the association does not mean that high opioid use causes reductions in labor force participation,” Molly Schnell, a postdoctoral fellow at the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research told Yahoo Finance. “The causal relationship between opioid prescribing and employment is considerably weaker and murkier than popular narratives suggest.”Cataldo Ambulance medics and other first responders revive a 32-year-old man who was found unresponsive and not breathing after an opioid overdose on a sidewalk in the Boston suburb of Everett, Massachusetts, U.S., August 23, 2017.

The findings were described as a “plausibly causal estimate of the effect of opioid misuse on labor market exits.”Adriana is an associate editor for Yahoo Finance.
