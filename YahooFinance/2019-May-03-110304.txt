SubscribeWHAT TO WATCHInvestors are gearing up for what they hope will be another strong month for U.S. job creation after other signals of economic growth have turned higher.The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics releases its latest report on the domestic employment situation at 8:30 a.m. ET Friday. New non-farm payrolls are expected to total 190,000 for the month of April, according to consensus economist estimates compiled by Bloomberg, down just slightly from March’s 196,000 additions.Employment growth averaged 180,000 per month in the first three months of 2019, versus an average of 223,000 per month in 2018. This year’s average was dragged down by February’s tepid 33,000 payroll additions, which many analysts have attributed to inclement weather and other temporary factors.The unemployment rate is anticipated to have held at 3.8% in April, unchanged from the month prior. Such a reading would reaffirm an already tight labor market, with recent data pointing to ongoing business struggles to find qualified workers to fill open positions. The National Federation of Independent Business’s latest survey on small business optimism, for instance, noted that 39% of all owners reported job openings they could not fill during the survey period, matching a record high set in December.Average hourly wages are expected to have grown 3.3% year-over-year and 0.3% month-over-month, an improvement from the slight easing in wage growth seen from February to March.Read moreTOP NEWSBerkshire Hathaway Chairman and CEO Warren Buffett, right, and his Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, left, speak during an interview in Omaha, Neb., Monday, May 7, 2018, with Liz Claman on Fox Business Network's "Countdown to the Closing Bell".
