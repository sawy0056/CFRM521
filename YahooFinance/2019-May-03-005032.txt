Amazon did not immediately respond to a similar request.Shares of companies often rise when Berkshire reveals its support through new stakes, even when the purchases are believed or known to have been made by Combs or Weschler, who together invest about $26 billion.The initial impetus of the portfolio managers has in the past heralded Buffett's eventual forays into some of their investments, often in big ways.[Click here for coverage of the 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Shareholders Meeting.]It was Combs who in 2012 began investing in industrial and aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts Corp. Four years later, Berkshire completed its purchase of that company for $32 billion, in what remains Buffett's largest acquisition.More recently, it was either Combs or Weschler who in 2016 began investing in iPhone maker Apple Inc.But it was Buffett who ramped up that stake into Berkshire's largest common stock investment, more than 255 million shares, now worth roughly $53 billion.The Amazon purchase adds an additional bond between Buffett and Bezos, whose companies teamed up last year with JPMorgan Chase & Co to form a new venture, Haven, to reduce employee healthcare costs.Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors, and often buys stocks when buying whole companies appears too expensive.In February, Buffett called acquisition prices "sky-high for businesses possessing decent long-term prospects."Buffett and Berkshire Vice Chairman Charlie Munger will on Saturday answer shareholder questions at Berkshire's annual meeting in Omaha, Nebraska, which normally draws more than 40,000 people. (Reporting by Aakash Jagadeesh Babu in Bengaluru and Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Editing by Rosalba O'Brien)ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextWarren Buffett bashes Bitcoin again, labels it a 'gambling device'Coin RivetDid You Manage To Avoid Universal Electronics's (NASDAQ:UEIC) 40% Share Price Drop?Simply Wall St.Here's What Hedge Funds Think About Laredo Petroleum Inc (LPI)Insider MonkeyAmazon, Facebook Lead 5 Top Stocks To Watch: Which Are Near Buys?Investor's Business DailyForget UPS: Here's Who's Really at Risk as Amazon Expands Its Shipping ReachMotley FoolMaximum Security owner weighs options after disqualificationAssociated PressIn abrupt turn, Trump vows higher U.S. tariffs on China goodsReutersMunger: Bitcoin investors celebrate 'Judas Iscariot' at their happy hoursYahoo FinanceThis is one of the most luxurious gyms in the U.S.Yahoo Finance VideoWelly, Method founder looks to traditional retail to boost band aid salesYahoo FinanceDisney World and Disneyland Survive Bans on Smoking and Large StrollersMotley FoolWhy Berkshire Hathaway is 'so very peculiar,' according to Charlie MungerYahoo FinanceWill Disney Increase Hotel Rates When Star Wars Land Opens?Motley FoolBerkshire Hathaway's business meeting and Yahoo Finance's aftershowYahoo Finance VideoForget royal weddings: The US is the most expensive place to get hitchedYahoo FinanceWATCH: 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingYahoo Finance VideoKim oversees missile firing drills, tells troops to be alertAssociated PressBerkshire Hathaway Q1 earnings grow, but Kraft Heinz is missingYahoo FinanceBuffett on Tesla, selling cars onlineYahoo Finance VideoCBS has a 'white problem': former executiveYahoo FinanceVanguard Founder Jack Bogle's Investment Tips, 12 Years LaterBloombergBerkshire's Buffett, Munger on succession plansYahoo Finance VideoWarren Buffett: I'm a 'card-carrying capitalist,' rejects US embrace of socialismYahoo FinanceBerkshire's Buffett on portfolio strategyYahoo Finance VideoHighlights from the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting: Morning BriefYahoo FinanceU.S Mortgages – Mortgage Rates Fall for the 1st Time in 4-WeeksFX EmpireCharlie Munger: 'If you want one mantra, it comes from' Singapore's first prime ministerYahoo FinanceHere's how much money the winning jockey at the Kentucky Derby will earnCNBCBuffett on See's Candy growth strategyYahoo Finance VideoBuffett and Munger sound off on Brexit at Berkshire meeting: 'horrible' and 'a mistake'Yahoo FinanceThe TurboTax scandal provides a key lesson about tax preparersYahoo Finance2 Dividend Stocks I'd Buy Right NowMotley Fool
