They’re staying on the sidelines.“We don’t have it in our portfolios,” Gibbs told Alexis Christoforous and Brian Sozzi on The First Trade. “It’s very much wait and see for us until you really start seeing momentum, seeing their new management initiatives come through, and start seeing them come back to growth.”Both earnings and revenue beat expectaions last quarter. GE shares traded as high as $10.53 on Tuesday, up 8% for the day before closing at $10.17.Even GE is calling 2019 a “reset year,” and is sticking to its previously given forecast. Even CEO Larry Culp is expressing caution that results going forward could not be as rosy."One quarter is a data point not a trend,” Culp said on a conference call with analysts.General Electric logo appears above a trading post on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (AP Photo/Richard Drew)MoreIn the company’s earnings statement, Culp said the Q1 results were “largely driven by timing of certain items, which should balance out over the course of the year.”Former floor trader Stephen Guilfoyle has been buying far-dated options so he can capitalize on GE in the future.“I think Larry Culp is the right guy for that job,” he tells Yahoo Finance. “I wouldn’t want that job.”ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMaximum Security owner weighs options after disqualificationAssociated PressIn abrupt turn, Trump vows higher U.S. tariffs on China goodsReutersForget UPS: Here's Who's Really at Risk as Amazon Expands Its Shipping ReachMotley FoolGoogle's Pixel 3a XL Spotted in the WildInvestorPlaceThis is one of the most luxurious gyms in the U.S.Yahoo Finance VideoWelly, Method founder looks to traditional retail to boost band aid salesYahoo FinanceMunger: Bitcoin investors celebrate 'Judas Iscariot' at their happy hoursYahoo FinanceDisney World and Disneyland Survive Bans on Smoking and Large StrollersMotley FoolWhy Berkshire Hathaway is 'so very peculiar,' according to Charlie MungerYahoo FinanceHere's What Hedge Funds Think About ARMOUR Residential REIT, Inc.
