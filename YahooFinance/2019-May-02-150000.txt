This means thinking about the courses, school projects, experiences and internships you should be acquiring throughout your college career, she says.“When it’s time for you to apply for a job, your story and your path has already been carved,” she says. If you’re trying to figure out what you want to do with your career, Tipograph shares her tips for making a career plan before you graduate.Take a career assessmentTipograph recommends taking a career assessment to refine the kind of career you think you would be suited for.“There are many young people today who really don’t know what they should be doing, because they don’t know where their interests, their skills and their experiences all intersect,” Tipograph says. She recommends taking an assessment before picking a major and then again during your junior and senior years when it’s time to find internships.This way, students will know what kinds of jobs are out there and the skills they need for them while they’re still in school. Additionally, Tipograph says students should be practicing “soft skills” like communication, critical thinking and collaboration. When it’s time to apply for a job, you’ll have everything you need.Write a concise resumeTipograph says recruiters typically spend six seconds scanning a resume, so students need to be mindful of what they’re putting on it and keeping it to one page. For things you’d like to elaborate on, use your LinkedIn profile, she says.“Every recruiter will look at that, and that’s where more of your story can come out,” Tipograph says.When you’re sending your resume out, Tipograph says you should not just blast it out to any job you think could be a fit. Instead, focus your search.“When you apply to too many things that you're not qualified for, the rejection increases,” she says. “Take the time to analyze the job and your qualifications, and the chances of actually speaking to a recruiter will increase.”Making a personal connection will help you during your job interview.MoreAce the interviewTipograph says it’s important to make a personal connection with your interviewer—make sure you do some research beforehand and find some common ground, whether that’s something you’ve discovered on their LinkedIn profile or through a connection with someone else that works at the company.And practice, practice, practice, Tipograph says.“It's so important to do a lot of rehearsing because as you practice, it becomes easier to say things in a shorter amount of time —your answers will be on target,” she says.Be prepared to be patient, but keep your eye on different opportunities that come your way, Tipograph says.“It takes seven and a half months on average to get a job for a college grad and the longer it takes, you need to explain to them why you're not hired,” she says. “It’s important to always focus on the next opportunity even if you’re moving ahead in terms of a job opportunity.”WATCH MORE 5 tips to boost your careerCareer coaches explain the best way to ask for a raise5 practical ways to pursue your dream careerReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextMaximum Security owner weighs options after disqualificationAssociated PressIn abrupt turn, Trump vows higher U.S. tariffs on China goodsReutersForget UPS: Here's Who's Really at Risk as Amazon Expands Its Shipping ReachMotley FoolThis couple is one year away from having enough money to retire early — here's what they didMarketWatchThis is one of the most luxurious gyms in the U.S.Yahoo Finance VideoWelly, Method founder looks to traditional retail to boost band aid salesYahoo FinanceMunger: Bitcoin investors celebrate 'Judas Iscariot' at their happy hoursYahoo FinanceDisney World and Disneyland Survive Bans on Smoking and Large StrollersMotley FoolWhy Berkshire Hathaway is 'so very peculiar,' according to Charlie MungerYahoo Finance3 Top Oil Stocks to Buy Right NowMotley FoolBerkshire Hathaway's business meeting and Yahoo Finance's aftershowYahoo Finance VideoForget royal weddings: The US is the most expensive place to get hitchedYahoo FinanceWill Disney Increase Hotel Rates When Star Wars Land Opens?Motley FoolWATCH: 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingYahoo Finance VideoKim oversees missile firing drills, tells troops to be alertAssociated PressBoeing says safety review corroborated its findings on a 737 MAX sensorReutersBerkshire's Buffett on portfolio strategyYahoo Finance VideoCBS has a 'white problem': former executiveYahoo FinanceBerkshire Hathaway Q1 earnings grow, but Kraft Heinz is missingYahoo FinanceVanguard Founder Jack Bogle's Investment Tips, 12 Years LaterBloombergBerkshire's Buffett, Munger on succession plansYahoo Finance Video3 Stocks to Build Your Portfolio AroundMotley FoolBuffett on See's Candy growth strategyYahoo Finance VideoHighlights from the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting: Morning BriefYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett: I'm a 'card-carrying capitalist,' rejects US embrace of socialismYahoo FinanceU.S Mortgages – Mortgage Rates Fall for the 1st Time in 4-WeeksFX EmpireCharlie Munger: 'If you want one mantra, it comes from' Singapore's first prime ministerYahoo FinanceA Tequila Sommelier on How to Drink Mexico's Favorite SpiritFortuneBuffett on Berkshire's risk model: There's no formulaYahoo Finance VideoBuffett and Munger sound off on Brexit at Berkshire meeting: 'horrible' and 'a mistake'Yahoo FinanceHere's how much money the winning jockey at the Kentucky Derby will earnCNBCThe TurboTax scandal provides a key lesson about tax preparersYahoo Finance
