Dunkin Brands (DNKN) and Under Armour (UAA) both report before the bell.According to data compiled by Bloomberg, the coffee chain is expected to report adjusted earnings of 62 cents per share on $312.6 million in revenue during the first quarter.“With a full quarter under the belt of the Dunkin’ rebranding, the reinvigorated espresso platform as well as a better attack on value, we expect Dunkin’ U.S. to post its best quarterly [same-store sales] performance since 4Q16,” Wells Fargo analyst Jon Tower wrote in a note April 23. “We believe Dunkin’s pivot to being a beverage-led brand with a focus on improving quality and speed while also pulsing an everyday value message (specifically tied to food) will position Dunkin’ to compete better over the long-term.”Dunkin’ shares have risen 15% so far in 2019 but have been underperforming the broader market, which has jumped 18% in the same time period.Meanwhile, Under Armour is expected to report and adjusted earnings loss of less than one cent per share on revenue of $1.18 billion.Pivotal analyst Mitch Kummetz predicts in-line results. “We’re modeling 1Q in line with guidance, but we wouldn’t be surprised by a modest sales/EPS beat, as guidance is a low bar. For the quarter, we doubt that UAA’s sales trajectory was much different than the company’s recent run rate, as we don’t believe there was marked change in consumer demand or retail sell-through from prior quarters.”The North America region continues to be a challenge for Under Armour, but Stifel thinks 2019 might be a different story. “In 2019, we expect continued improvement in North American margin is complemented by ongoing growth in international operating profit. North America revenue inflection remains a watch point.”Other notable earnings reports scheduled for Thursday include Church & Dwight (CHD), Cigna (CI), Discovery (DISCA), DowDuPont (DWDP), Dunkin Brands (DNKN), Kellogg (K), Pacific Gas & Electric (PCG), Royal Dutch Shell (RDS-A), Sprout’s Farmers Market (SFM), Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), Under Armour (UAA), YETI (YETI) before market open; Activision Blizzard (ATVI), CBS (CBS), Expedia (EXPE), Gilead (GILD), Shake Shack (SHAK), U.S. Steel (X), Weight Watchers (WW) after market close.—Heidi Chung is a reporter at Yahoo Finance.
