As more hope builds related to ending the painful trade war, Holtz-Eakin believes the “markets are going to reward simply stopping the war.”Investors, business leaders, and the Trump administration are hoping that U.S. and Chinese officials can finish building a comprehensive deal in the next few weeks.Holtz-Eakin noted that in any deal, “the global trading community would want the tariffs to go away.” (The American Action Forum is a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit issue advocacy group based that promotes center-right public policy.)Chinese Vice Premier Liu He, right, poses with U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, center, and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, left, before they proceed to their meeting at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse in Beijing, Wednesday, May 1, 2019.

And while there is eagerness to move forward in a deal, many industries would prefer the U.S. to negotiate further in order to truly address the current problems at stake.“The real question is how can [a resolution] happen? I think the enforcement and the tariffs are tightly linked in the President’s mind,” Holtz-Eakin said. “He thinks of keeping the tariffs in place as the mechanism that forces the Chinese to comply with whatever agreement they’ve reached.”Remaining issues include U.S. concerns over intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers, tariffs between both counties, supply chain disruption, enforcement of any deal, and how markets would weigh any announced resolution.Follow Yahoo Finance on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Flipboard, SmartNews, LinkedIn,YouTube, and reddit.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextFed up Canada tells U.S. to help with China crisis or forget about favorsReutersMaximum Security owner weighs options after disqualificationAssociated PressIn abrupt turn, Trump vows higher U.S. tariffs on China goodsReutersForget UPS: Here's Who's Really at Risk as Amazon Expands Its Shipping ReachMotley FoolCan a Divorced Woman Collect Social Security from Her Ex-Husband?InvestopediaThis is one of the most luxurious gyms in the U.S.Yahoo Finance VideoWelly, Method founder looks to traditional retail to boost band aid salesYahoo FinanceMunger: Bitcoin investors celebrate 'Judas Iscariot' at their happy hoursYahoo FinanceDisney World and Disneyland Survive Bans on Smoking and Large StrollersMotley FoolWhy Berkshire Hathaway is 'so very peculiar,' according to Charlie MungerYahoo FinanceThe Downside of Low UnemploymentInvestopediaBerkshire Hathaway's business meeting and Yahoo Finance's aftershowYahoo Finance VideoForget royal weddings: The US is the most expensive place to get hitchedYahoo FinanceWill Disney Increase Hotel Rates When Star Wars Land Opens?Motley FoolWATCH: 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingYahoo Finance VideoKim oversees missile firing drills, tells troops to be alertAssociated PressHere's What You're Missing About Joe Biden's Stance on MarijuanaMotley FoolBuffett on Tesla, selling cars onlineYahoo Finance VideoCBS has a 'white problem': former executiveYahoo FinanceBerkshire Hathaway Q1 earnings grow, but Kraft Heinz is missingYahoo FinanceVanguard Founder Jack Bogle's Investment Tips, 12 Years LaterBloombergBerkshire's Buffett, Munger on succession plansYahoo Finance VideoThis Social Security Prediction Will Be Proved Wrong in 2019Motley FoolBerkshire's Buffett on portfolio strategyYahoo Finance VideoHighlights from the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting: Morning BriefYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett: I'm a 'card-carrying capitalist,' rejects US embrace of socialismYahoo FinanceU.S Mortgages – Mortgage Rates Fall for the 1st Time in 4-WeeksFX EmpireCharlie Munger: 'If you want one mantra, it comes from' Singapore's first prime ministerYahoo FinanceIran to keep enriching uranium despite U.S. move - parliament speakerReutersBuffett on See's Candy growth strategyYahoo Finance VideoBuffett and Munger sound off on Brexit at Berkshire meeting: 'horrible' and 'a mistake'Yahoo FinanceHere's how much money the winning jockey at the Kentucky Derby will earnCNBC
