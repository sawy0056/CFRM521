Aspire uses crickets to whip up a range of protein-packed food products. Beyond Meat’s well-received debut ultimately validates the alternative food movement and boosts the valuations of businesses just like Chambers’ Aspire.“I am a huge believer in the space. Two years ago I bet on crickets as a major source of protein,” Chambers told Yahoo Finance. Chambers, who now boasts a portfolio of 18 upstart companies as founder of VC firm JC2 Ventures, adding “I am glad Beyond Meat [shares] popped today — they are a disruptor.”To say the management team at Beyond Meat, a meat-substitute company, will sleep well today may be an understatement.Beyond Meat shares exploded 162% to $65.60 in their debut on the Nasdaq Composite today.

He added it’s good to see the market reward the company for its innovation.“We really are focused on our business and on executing against our strategy. I’m going to try to drive the growth and value of the business by focusing on the fundamentals,” Brown said.Investors do need to remember, however, that Beyond Meat has never been profitable. Beyond Meat lost $29.9 million in 2018 on $87.9 million in sales. To achieve sustainable profits, it will need a range of new products and more distribution channels.
