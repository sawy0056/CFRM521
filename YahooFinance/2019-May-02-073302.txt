Those positions include three global category managers, a senior financial analyst, and a HR Specialist.“While the number is small, these employees will help build the foundation of our workforce and workplace,” Ardine Williams, Amazon’s vice president of workforce development, wrote in a blog post.The retail giant did not disclose exact salary figures, but the company has said in a memorandum the average job salary would be $150,000. Williams wrote they are “on pace to create 400 new jobs this year, and a total of 25,000 over the next decade plus.”Dealbreaker’s Executive Editor Thornton McEnery believes the retail giant will keep its end of the bargain it made with state and local officials, who gave Amazon an incentive package worth $750 million.“You create 25,000 jobs, you get the [financial incentives] we talked about. Period. End of discussion,” McEnery told YFi PM.‘Ahead of schedule’Amazon will be leasing temporary space in Crystal City for its first employees to start in June. The company has originally planned to start in October this year.The company has pledged to invest $2.5 billion dollars to “occupy 4 million square feet of energy efficient office space,” and says it’s “ahead of schedule” for starting operations.Last year, the company held a highly publicized process to select its second headquarters, but drew heat over proposed tax incentives officials made to reel Amazon in. The controversy grew amid accusations the company has paid zero federal income for two straight years.Amazon originally decided to split HQ2 between two locations, Crystal City and Long Island City in Queens, New York. Yet the plan was foiled as a vocal contingent of politicians, including newly-elected Democratic U.S. Representative Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez, voiced opposition.Over the opposition of New York City’s mayor and the state’s governor, Amazon then cancelled its New York plans — a decision some have called rash.“This was a mistake. Things got a little too hot too quickly,” McEnery told YFi PM.“This deal wasn’t perfect and no one came out looking like the best actor,” he added.ReblogShareTweetShareRecently ViewedYour list is empty.What to Read NextAmazon, Facebook Lead 5 Top Stocks To Watch: Which Are Near Buys?Investor's Business DailyNordstrom Local Service Hubs Are Coming to NYCMotley Fool7 Takeaways From The Berkshire Hathaway Annual MeetingInvestopediaBuffett says Amazon stock purchase doesn't deviate from value-investing principlesMarketWatchIf You Had Invested Right After Amazon's IPOInvestopediaMaximum Security owner weighs options after disqualificationAssociated PressIn abrupt turn, Trump vows higher U.S. tariffs on China goodsReutersForget UPS: Here's Who's Really at Risk as Amazon Expands Its Shipping ReachMotley FoolGoogle's Pixel 3a XL Spotted in the WildInvestorPlaceThis is one of the most luxurious gyms in the U.S.Yahoo Finance VideoWelly, Method founder looks to traditional retail to boost band aid salesYahoo FinanceMunger: Bitcoin investors celebrate 'Judas Iscariot' at their happy hoursYahoo FinanceWarren Buffett on what he values most in life: 'It's the two things you can't buy'Yahoo FinanceDisney World and Disneyland Survive Bans on Smoking and Large StrollersMotley FoolTrump's tariffs could knock Tesla's Autopilot off courseTechCrunchBerkshire Hathaway's business meeting and Yahoo Finance's aftershowYahoo Finance VideoForget royal weddings: The US is the most expensive place to get hitchedYahoo FinanceWhy Berkshire Hathaway is 'so very peculiar,' according to Charlie MungerYahoo FinanceWill Disney Increase Hotel Rates When Star Wars Land Opens?Motley FoolWATCH: 2019 Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders MeetingYahoo Finance VideoThis week in tech history: Microsoft announces its first 'real' laptopEngadgetBerkshire's Buffett on portfolio strategyYahoo Finance VideoHighlights from the Berkshire Hathaway Annual Shareholders Meeting: Morning BriefYahoo FinanceKim oversees missile firing drills, tells troops to be alertAssociated PressBerkshire Hathaway Q1 earnings grow, but Kraft Heinz is missingYahoo FinanceVanguard Founder Jack Bogle's Investment Tips, 12 Years LaterBloombergYour Domino's pizza may soon be delivered by a robotCoin RivetBuffett on See's Candy growth strategyYahoo Finance VideoBuffett and Munger sound off on Brexit at Berkshire meeting: 'horrible' and 'a mistake'Yahoo FinanceBerkshire's Buffett, Munger on succession plansYahoo Finance VideoWarren Buffett: I'm a 'card-carrying capitalist,' rejects US embrace of socialismYahoo FinanceU.S Mortgages – Mortgage Rates Fall for the 1st Time in 4-WeeksFX Empire
